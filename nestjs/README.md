# Code Samples Repository

## Overview

This repository contains code samples for web application development using various technologies and frameworks. The samples are organized into separate folders for different technologies, including Laravel, Nest.js, and Koa.js.

### Sample Code Sections

- **Laravel**: Sample code for web application development using the Laravel PHP framework.
- **Nest.js**: Sample code for building server-side applications using the Nest.js TypeScript framework.
- **Koa.js**: Sample code demonstrating web application development with the Koa.js framework.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js and NPM/Yarn**: Make sure you have Node.js and a package manager installed on your local machine.

- **PHP and Composer (for Laravel)**: If you're working with the Laravel code samples, you'll need PHP and Composer installed.
